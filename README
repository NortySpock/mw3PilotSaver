This is a simple little tool I wrote to backup game files if they change. 

This was based on an internet rumor that MechWarrior 3 save files could be corrupted (not have loot at the end) if you restarted the mission. 
So I plan to run this in the background to automatically archive the save file if I need to.

Note: The python script should work.
The go program is incomplete and should not be expected to work.
